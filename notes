Later:
  - Task end dates - added to DB. Needs to result in it being eternally 'done' and not showing last week of tasks. Task history needs to go from finish date rather than current date.
  - Task deletion
  - Weekly tasks
  - Show hit/miss rate for time periods on task (not just the last week) - need a task info page)
  - Show completion text in output
  - Metrics on completed tasks
  - Make it look better
  - Upgrade bootstrap+others
  - Plan test+upgrade schedule for requirements (including bootstrap, etc)
  - Check for secure redirection: http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/62/
  - Make task completion page nicer
  - Tests, including ensuring no external calls, limited numbers of calls on pages, limited DB calls on pages.
  - API?
