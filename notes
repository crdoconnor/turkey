- DONE - 1. Create goal (can have subgoals) (model on location)
- DONE - 2. Create task:
           - Associated goal
           - Task name
- DONE - 3. Complete task:
           - Date (implicit, not prompted)
           - Comment (optional)
- DONE - 4. Plumbing:
           - Task shows differently on homepage if completed today
           - Task not yet completed today has 'Complete task' functionality on click (or on adjacent button?)


Later:
  - Task end dates
  - Weekly tasks
  - Show hit/miss rate for time periods on task
  - Metrics on completed tasks
  - Goals/tasks/completed associated with individual user
  - Make it look better
  - Upgrade bootstrap+others
  - Plan test+upgrade schedule for requirements (including bootstrap, etc)
  - Check for secure redirection: http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/62/
  - Make task completion page nicer; make it handle not existing task (redirect to home page and flash message)
